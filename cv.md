## About myself:

I am a fourth-year student at the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics, majoring in Information Systems and Technologies. I have a strong passion for Java application development and I am eager to pursue a career in this field while continuously expanding my knowledge of new technologies. As a motivated individual, I thrive on tackling complex problems and finding innovative solutions. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute as an intern or junior Java backend developer.
